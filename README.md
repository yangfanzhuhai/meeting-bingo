# Meeting Bingo

This was originally an implementation of the boardgame [CODENAMES](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames).

It generates a random 5 by 5 grid from a list of words.

Here, it has been adapted to generate a 4 by 4 grid for playing meeting bingo. Taken from MOE ESTL folks.
